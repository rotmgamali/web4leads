Subject: Quick question about {{ school_name }}

Hi {{ first_name }},

I've been following the progress at {{ school_name }} and was impressed by the community you're building there. 

I work with private schools on college readiness resources, and I'm curious how you're currently thinking about SAT/ACT prep support for your students. I'd love to hear what's working best for your school this year.

Would you have a few minutes for a casual chat?

Best,
