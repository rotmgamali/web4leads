Subject: Supporting families at {{ school_name }}

Hi {{ first_name }},

I wanted to follow up with some specifics that might be valuable for the {{ school_name }} community. 

We help private schools offer high-quality SAT/ACT prep for just $375 (usually $850+). Our students see an average increase of 150+ points on the SAT, which has helped them secure over $125k in merit scholarships.

**For {{ school_name }}:**
- Zero cost to the school
- No extra workload for your team
- We provide all the flyers and resources
- Families sign up directly with us

Would you have 15 minutes to chat about how this could benefit your students?

Best,
