Subject: Supporting student-athletes at {{ school_name }}

Hi {{ first_name }},

Following up on my last email—I wanted to share how we help athletic directors support their students' academic goals.

At Aspire Academy, we offer discounted SAT/ACT prep that fits into busy practice and game schedules. Our students see average improvements of 150+ points, which is often the difference-maker for athletic scholarship eligibility.

**What Victory Christian Academy gets:**
- Zero cost to {{ school_name }}
- Flexible online classes that work around practice
- High-impact results (average 150+ point increase)
- Ready-to-use materials for your parent meetings

Would you have 15 minutes this week for a quick call? 

Best,
