Subject: Enhancing Value at {{ school_name }} (Zero Cost)

Hi {{ first_name }},

Following up on my last email—I wanted to share a specific way we help {{ school_name }} provide more value to families without any budget impact.

We offer your families deeply discounted SAT/ACT prep ($375 for 20 hours of live instruction). Our students see an average increase of 150+ points on the SAT, which helps them secure over $125k in merit scholarships on average.

**For the Business Office:**
- 100% Zero Cost to {{ school_name }}
- No administrative burden
- Ready-made materials for marketing and newsletters
- Justifies tuition through measurable college outcomes

Would you have 15 minutes for a quick Zoom this week? 

Best,
