Subject: Quick question regarding {{ school_name }}

Hi {{ first_name }},

I came across {{ school_name }} while researching independent schools in Florida—you've built an impressive program there.

I work with school business leaders on zero-cost value-add resources for families. I'm curious how you're currently thinking about student support services as a way to enhance parent satisfaction and justify the unique value of a {{ school_name }} education.

Would you have a few minutes for a brief chat?

Best,
