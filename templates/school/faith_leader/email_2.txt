Subject: Supporting families at {{ school_name }}

Hi {{ first_name }},

I wanted to follow up with some specifics that might be a blessing for your families at {{ school_name }}. 

We help faith-based schools offer deeply discounted SAT/ACT prep—$375 for a program that usually costs $850+. Our students consistently see average improvements of 150+ points on the SAT, which has helped many families secure $125k+ in merit scholarships.

**For your community:**
- Zero cost to {{ school_name }}
- No extra work for your staff
- We provide all the flyers and newsletter resources
- Helps families afford college through improved scholarship chances

Would you have 15 minutes to chat about how this could benefit your students?

Blessings,
Andrew, Aspire Academy
