Subject: Quick question about {{ school_name }}

Hi {{ first_name }},

I hope this message finds you well. I've been following the community you're building at {{ school_name }}—I know that in faith-based education, the focus is on the whole person, and academic success is a key part of that mission.

I work with private schools on college readiness resources that families genuinely appreciate. I'm curious how {{ school_name }} is currently supporting students in their journey toward college and life after school.

Would you have a few minutes to chat? I'd love to hear how things are going for your community.

Blessings,
Andrew, Aspire Academy
