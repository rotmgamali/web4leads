Subject: Quick question about {{ school_name }}

Hi {{ first_name }},

I hope your week is off to a great start. 

I've been following what you're doing at {{ school_name }}—I was particularly interested to see your focus on academic excellence and student development. I work with school leaders on college readiness resources, and I'm curious how you're currently approaching test prep support for your families.

Would you be open to a quick chat? I'd love to hear your perspective on what's working best for your students.

Best,
Andrew, Aspire Academy
