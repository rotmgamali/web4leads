Subject: Quick question about {{ school_name }}

Hi {{ first_name }},

I came across {{ school_name }} while researching independent schools in Florida—your commitment to building a unique learning environment really stands out.

I work with school leaders on college readiness programs, and I'm curious how you're currently supporting families when it comes to the SAT/ACT. I'd love to hear your thoughts on how your community is navigating the current admissions landscape.

Would you be open to a brief, casual chat? I'm simply looking to learn what's top of mind for you.

Best,
