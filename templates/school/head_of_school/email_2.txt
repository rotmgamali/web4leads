Subject: Differentiation and Outcomes at {{ school_name }}

Hi {{ first_name }},

I wanted to follow up on my previous note. At Aspire Academy, we focus on helping independent schools differentiate their "Value Prop" through superior college outcomes.

We provide your families with deeply discounted, premium SAT/ACT prep—$375 for 20 hours of live instruction. Our results are well-documented: 150+ point average SAT increases and over $125k in merit scholarship awards per student.

For {{ school_name }}, this is a zero-cost value-add. We provide ready-made materials for your newsletters and parent information sessions, and your families deal with us directly.

Would you have 15 minutes for a quick Zoom? You can see a bit more of how we partner with schools here: https://ibforschools.info/

Best,
