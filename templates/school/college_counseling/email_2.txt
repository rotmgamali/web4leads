Subject: Merit Scholarship Support for {{ school_name }} Students

Hi {{ first_name }},

I wanted to follow up with some data on how we support college counseling offices in boosting merit scholarship outcomes.

Our students see an average increase of 150+ points on the SAT, which directly correlates to an average of $125,000+ in merit aid awards. We offer {{ school_name }} families 20 hours of live instruction for just $375 (over 50% off retail).

We provide ready-to-use flyers and newsletter blurbs so you can easily share this without any extra admin work on your part.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to see if this would be a helpful resource for your juniors and seniors? 

Best,
Andrew, Aspire Academy
