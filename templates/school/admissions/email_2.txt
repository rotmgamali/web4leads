Subject: Boosting Enrollment Value for {{ school_name }} Families

Hi {{ first_name }},

Following up on my last email—I wanted to share how we help admissions teams differentiate their school's value to prospective families.

We partner with independent schools to offer deeply discounted SAT/ACT prep ($375 for 20 hours). It’s a tangible benefit you can highlight during admissions events and in your recruitment materials. Our students see an average increase of 150+ points and earn significant merit scholarships.

For {{ school_name }}, there's zero cost and zero administrative work. We provide all the flyers and copy for your newsletters.

Would you be open to a 15-minute chat to see if this aligns with your enrollment strategy?

Best,
