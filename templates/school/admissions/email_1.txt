Subject: {{ school_name }} families and college prep

Hi {{ first_name }},

I've been reviewing your admissions materials at {{ school_name }}—it's clear that your community values both academic excellence and student success.

In your role as Director of Admissions, I imagine you're often speaking with prospective families about college readiness. I'm curious how you're currently addressing their questions about test prep support. I work with independent schools to provide resources that families genuinely appreciate during the enrollment process.

Would you have a few minutes for a quick chat? I'd love to hear your insights.

Best,
Andrew, Aspire Academy
