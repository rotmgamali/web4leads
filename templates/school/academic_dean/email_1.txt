Subject: Quick question about {{ school_name }} curriculum

Hi {{ first_name }},

I've been following the academic programs at {{ school_name }} and was impressed by your approach to student achievement. 

I collaborate with academic directors on supplemental college readiness resources, and I'm curious how you're currently integrating test prep support into the curriculum or student services. I'd love to hear what's working best for your learners.

Would you have a few minutes to chat? 

Best,
