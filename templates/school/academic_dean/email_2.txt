Subject: Supporting Academic Outcomes at {{ school_name }}

Hi {{ first_name }},

Following up on my last email—I wanted to share how we support academic deans in boosting student outcomes without adding to the workload.

We offer your families discounted, live-online SAT/ACT prep for just $375. Our students see an average increase of 150+ points, which significantly impacts their college options and merit aid eligibility.

We can also provide:
- Free Parent Education Nights
- 1-Hour Study Skills Workshops
- No-cost flyers and newsletter copy

Would you be open to a 15-minute chat to explore if this would be a valuable resource for {{ school_name }} this year? 

Best,
Genelle, Aspire Academy
100+ Point Improvement Guarantee
