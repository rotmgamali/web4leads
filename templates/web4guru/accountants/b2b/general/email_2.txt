Subject: Re: I want to get {{ company_name }} 5 new clients

{{ greeting }}

Just circling back quickly — I know tax season keeps things busy.

The offer still stands: my team will find business owners in {{ city }} who need an accountant and start warm conversations with them on {{ company_name }}'s behalf. The last firm we did this for went from zero inbound leads to 10 qualified calls in 14 days — 3 became paying clients.

We'll do the first week completely free. No contracts, no setup fees. If it doesn't deliver, you lose nothing.

Would it be alright if I called you this week to walk through the setup? Takes less than 5 minutes.

Best,
Andrew
